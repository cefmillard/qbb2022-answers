Great job! Everything looks complete and correct. Please remember to include the commands you used for each exercises, even dumb stuff like copying files (ex: I think you're missing the commands for answering 5C).

It's awesome that you got to the fun exercises as well. Kind of cool that you can see that C -> T mutations are the most common, right?
