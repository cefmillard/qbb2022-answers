Great plots for the tensorflow walkthrough! Did you record your commands anywhere?

What's the plot look like for your model prediction/correlation analysis? Looking at the script, I'm curious if all of the lines there are necessary (those that are commented out, but a couple of others.), but it looks like the script is mostly runnable, except that it may never actually compute the correlation?

The website says to submit the following things:

1. A README file including any questions you had about this exercise, as well as the command you ran for Part 2 and your answers for the questions in Part 2
2. Your script for Part 1
3. At least one plot demonstrating your modelâ€™s performance from Part 1
4. Your plotting script for Part 2
5. The correlation plot for Part 2

I see 1, 3, and 4. Please add 2 and 5.

Once you add these, I'll give you full credit for any previous assignment you'd like. If you don't add these 2 things, I'll give you a 6/10 for any previous assignment you'd like. Which assignment is that?

**Edit: I now see part 2. I still don't see part 5. 8/10 for any previous assignment you'd like (which one)? Or after the plot is added, a full 10/10.**
