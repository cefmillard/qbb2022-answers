Exercise A.
The 0.55 in this function is setting the low end of the range, while the 1.05 is setting the high end of the range but is not itself included. The 0.05 is setting the interval between values in that range that will be added to the array. The command decimals=2 is capping the displayed decimals of values in this array at 2 decimal points. The [::-1] inverts the order of the array.
Exercise C.
As the probability of the unfair coin returning heads increases the power increases. As the number of tosses increases the power increases.
Exercise D.
The paper is looking at the phenomenon of transmission distortion, which is when certain alleles are transmitted from heterozygous parents to children at a rate greater than what could be expected with Mendel's Law of Segregation. Both are based on continuous data generated from simulations with varying probabilities. The simulations in the paper were run more times. Prob_heads correlates with transmission rate. The number of tosses corresponds to the number of sperm axis. They both used binomial tests because both are looking at continuous data.
