Your commented `vcfParser.py` script looks great and very comprehensive! If it makes you feel any better about python, you most likely won't have to use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section at the bottom unless you want to or if you go into like, python software development.

I don't see your answer to exercise 2 (annotating SNPs using the dbSNP database), so just remember to push that before the final deadline for bootcamp assignments.
