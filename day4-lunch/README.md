    + Covering 956640 bp
--- Subsetting protein_coding.chr21.bed.vcf
    + Covering 13780687 bp
b. open the files and look at them, make a script that compares whether their contents are the same (I don't know if metadata like when the files are recorded is included in the contents of the file, but if they were I could tell the computer to ignore parts of the file that correlate with that metadata and see if the other contents of the files match)
c.I found the gene types "IG V", "IG D", and "IG J" becuase you could look at changes in the presence of regions correlating with these gene types to see how VDJ recombination has occurred in certain people i.e. the length of these regions might change or some might be absent in cells that have undergone VDJ recombination.
