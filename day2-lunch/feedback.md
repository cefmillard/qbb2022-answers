Great work on this! Your code and solutions look complete and correct. I also like your use of whitespace in your bed parser code to separate out blocks of related code - I do this too for my own work. One minor suggestion for the bed parser is that it might help future you to comment the lines more extensively - you did a fantastic job of commenting for your analysis script though!
