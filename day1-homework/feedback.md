Great work! All your answers are complete and documented sufficiently.

Also good speculation on why A-G and C-T are the most common base pair changes. Evolutionary biologists, who are interested in how often particular mutations happen, have numbers for how frequent different mutations are, and transition mutations (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine) are way more common than transversion mutations (purine -> pyrimidine or vice versa).
