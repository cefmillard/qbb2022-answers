Excellent work so far! Everything you have looks great, we just need a few more things before this is done:
1. We still need your code for the regression (both models), the QQ plot for the model without sex, the volcano plot for the model with sex, and a comparison of the significant (10% FDR) transcripts between the two models (-5 points)

Let us know if you have any questions!
